          In my thesis, I developed a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that simultaneously optimizes user engagement and content diversity in large-scale recommender systems. By building a custom simulation and testing different policies, I showed how deep RL methods can discover flexible trade-offs among competing objectives—leading to more dynamic, user-centric recommendations.

          Experiments were conducted on the supercomputer infrastructure DAS-6.

          In my bachelor thesis, I explored why people share misleading COVID-19 information online. By conducting an online survey and analyzing social and psychological factors such as the need for connection and altruism, I found that while many variables had little impact, altruism emerged as a key driver behind misinformation sharing.
