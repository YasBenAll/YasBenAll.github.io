          In my thesis, I developed a multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) framework that simultaneously optimizes user engagement and content diversity in large-scale recommender systems. By building a custom simulation and testing different policies, I showed how deep RL methods can discover flexible trade-offs among competing objectives—leading to more dynamic, user-centric recommendations.

          Experiments were conducted on the supercomputer infrastructure _DAS-6_.

          In my bachelor thesis, I explored why people share misleading COVID-19 information online. By conducting an online survey and analyzing social and psychological factors such as the need for connection and altruism, I found that while many variables had little impact, altruism emerged as a key driver behind misinformation sharing.

        content: In this research paper, we examine the fairness algorithm Shifty. Shifty guarantees that a model adheres to the fairness constraint in the case of demographic shifts in the deployment distribution. As part of the Machine Learning Reproducibility Challenge 2022, this research paper was awarded by Kaggle with a prize of $10,000 in credit for the Google Cloud Platform. The paper was presented at the NeurIPS conference in 2023.
